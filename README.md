# Compacter
A simple Huffman-based file compressor and decompressor written in C.

## Features
- Compresses any type of file using the Huffman algorithm.
- Decompresses `.huff` files generated by the compressor.
- Supports binary files (e.g., images, executables, etc.).
- Outputs compressed files with `.huff` extension and reconstructs the original file on decompression.

## How to Build
1. Open the project folder in **VS Code** or any terminal.
2. Make sure you have `make` and `gcc` installed.
3. Open the terminal (use Bash if possible).
4. Run the following command to compile:

```bash
make build
```
This will generate an executable named "Compacter.out".

## How to use
./Compacter.out <encode | decode> <file_path>

- **To compress files**
```bash
./Compacter.out encode path/to/your/file
```
Always generate / replace a compressed.huff in the project's root.

- **To decompress file.huff**
```bash
./Compacter.out decode path/to/your/file.huff
```

## Tests
### Compressing a webp image
```bash
./Compacter.out encode tests/img.webp
```

### Decompressing the generated .huff file
```bash
./Compacter.out decode compressed.huff
```
